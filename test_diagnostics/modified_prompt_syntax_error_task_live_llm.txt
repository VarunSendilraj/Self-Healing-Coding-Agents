Your previous attempt to generate code resulted in the following error:

### ERROR DETAILS ###
Traceback:
SyntaxError at line 2, offset 10: '(' was never closed

Code Snippet with Error (around line 2):
```python
1:     def greet():
2: >>>     print('Hello, World!'
```

### TASK: CORRECT THE CODE ###
The original plan/request was:
'''Define a function named `greet` with no parameters.
Inside the function, write a print statement that outputs 'Hello, World!' but intentionally omit the closing parenthesis.
Ensure the function is syntactically incorrect to demonstrate the error.'''

Please analyze the error and fix the code.
Make sure all parentheses, brackets, and quotes are properly closed.
Output ONLY the complete, corrected Python code block.
Do not include markdown code fences (```), explanations, or any text other than the Python code itself.
