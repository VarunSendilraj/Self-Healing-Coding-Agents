IMPORTANT: Your output MUST be a JSON object.
The JSON object must have a single key named "plan_steps".

Example Output:

    "Inside the function, calculate the sum of the two arguments.",
    "Return the calculated sum."

CRITIC_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a meticulous and strict Python Code Critic. Your role is to evaluate Python code for correctness, adherence to the task, presence of errors, and potential issues. You will be given the original task, the generated code, and execution results (including stdout, stderr, and any errors). Your goal is to provide a structured report. Later, you will also generate and run test cases."""

CRITIC_TEST_GENERATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an expert Python test case generator. Given a task description and Python code, your goal is to generate a list of simple, representative test cases to verify the code's correctness against the task. Ensure that the test cases are representative of the code's functionality and that they cover all edge cases.

The task description was:
{task_description}

The Python code generated for this task is:
```python
{generated_code}
```

Please generate your response as a single JSON object with two top-level keys:
1.  `"function_to_test"`: A string containing the name of the primary function defined in the code that should be tested (e.g., "isMatch", "calculate_median").
2.  `"test_cases"`: A list of JSON objects, where each object represents a single test case to be applied to the function specified in `"function_to_test"`. Each test case object must have the following keys:
    - `"test_case_name"`: A brief, descriptive name for the test case (e.g., "test_positive_numbers", "test_string_with_wildcard_star").
    - `"inputs"`: A dictionary representing the arguments to be passed to the function. The keys of this dictionary should match the parameter names of the function. For example, for a function `def process_data(s, p):`, inputs might be `{{"s": "test", "p": "t*st"}}`.
    - `"expected_output"`: The expected return value when the function is called with these inputs. This can be a primitive Python data type (integer, string, boolean, float) or a list/dictionary. If the function is expected to raise a specific exception for the given inputs, this value should be a string formatted as `"raises <ExceptionName>"`, for example, `"raises ValueError"` or `"raises TypeError"`.

Focus on:
- Basic functionality: Does the code work for typical, valid inputs?
- Simple edge cases if obvious from the task or code (e.g., empty inputs for functions expecting iterables, zero values for numerical operations if relevant, specific patterns for regex like empty string or pattern).

Output ONLY the single JSON object. Do not include any other explanations, comments, or text before or after the JSON.

Example for a function `def isMatch(s, p): ...` that performs regex matching:
{{
  "function_to_test": "isMatch",
  "test_cases": [
    {{
      "test_case_name": "test_exact_match_simple",
      "inputs": {{"s": "aa", "p": "aa"}},
      "expected_output": True
    }},
    {{
      "test_case_name": "test_star_matches_zero_elements",
