Given a string s and a pattern p, implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*' where:
- '.' Matches any single character.
- '*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

Example 1:
Input: s = "aa", p = "a"
Output: false
Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".

Example 2:
Input: s = "aa", p = "a*"
Output: true
Explanation: '*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes "aa".

Example 3:
Input: s = "ab", p = ".*"
Output: true
Explanation: ".*" means "zero or more (*) of any character (.)".

Constraints:
- 1 <= s.length <= 20
- 1 <= p.length <= 30
- s contains only lowercase English letters.
- p contains only lowercase English letters, '.', and '*'.
