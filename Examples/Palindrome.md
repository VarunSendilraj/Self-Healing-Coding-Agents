## 🧠 Self-Healing Agentic AI Task Report

### ✅ Task Summary

**Task ID:** `interactive_task_palindromenumbergivenanin_210935`
**Description:**

> **Palindrome Number**
> Given an integer `x`, return `True` if `x` is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward), otherwise return `False`.

---

### ⚙️ Initial Prompt

```
You are an AI Python programmer. Output only the raw Python code.
```

### ✅ Code Generated (Iteration 1)

```python
def isPalindrome(x):
    if x < 0:
        return False
    original = x
    reversed_num = 0
    while x > 0:
        reversed_num = reversed_num * 10 + x % 10
        x = x // 10
    return original == reversed_num
```

### ✅ Test Results (2/2 Passed)

| Test Case                  | Input  | Expected Output | Result |
| -------------------------- | ------ | --------------- | ------ |
| test\_positive\_palindrome | `121`  | `True`          | ✅ Pass |
| test\_negative\_number     | `-121` | `False`         | ✅ Pass |

**Critic Summary:**
Code executed successfully. All test cases passed without requiring any self-healing. No logical or runtime issues were detected.
